# Random Password Generator

## Description

The motivation for this project was the desire to implement JavaScript functions, arrays, foor loops, and other methods in order to create an interactive webpage.

The reason for building this project was to create a Random Password Geneartor that would create a random password based on desired password criteria and length.

This project solves one major problem. Having to create your own passwords! You no longer have to come up with passwords on your own for the unending online profiles that we create. The random password generator creates a random password between the lenght of 8 and 128. The password can include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. At least one type of characters must be selected. Once a desired length is input, and the desired type of characters are selected, then a completely random password of the selected length will be created with a random selection of the desired characters.
